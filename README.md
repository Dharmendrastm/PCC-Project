Password Complexity Checker Project
This project focuses on developing a Password Complexity Checker aligned with OWASP standards to help users create strong, secure passwords. Using Python and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, this tool evaluates passwords for strength and provides real-time feedback to the user.
Key Features+
•	Enforced Security Standards:
The software checks for password strength based on the following criteria:
1.	Minimum Length: At least 8 characters.
2.	Uppercase Letters: Requires at least one uppercase letter.
3.	Lowercase Letters: Requires at least one lowercase letter.
4.	Digits: Requires at least one number.
5.	Special Characters: Includes at least one special character (e.g.,!@#$%^&*()).
6.	Avoid Public Information: Discourages passwords that contain parts of the username or easily guessable public information.
•	Passphrase Encouragement:
Instead of traditional passwords, users are encouraged to use passphrases, making it easier to create memorable but secure credentials.
•	Real-Time Feedback:
Users receive immediate feedback and suggestions to improve their passwords until they meet all the security criteria.
Technologies Used
•	Language: Python
•	GUI Library: the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Password Complexity Checker
Advantages of the Password Complexity Checker
1.	Enhanced Security: Encourages users to create strong passwords by evaluating and improving complexity.
2.	Immediate Feedback: Provides real-time suggestions to help users meet security criteria.
3.	User Awareness: Educates users on what constitutes a strong password (length, character variety, etc.).
4.	Prevents Weak Passwords: Reduces the risk of easily guessable or vulnerable passwords.
5.	Easy Integration: Can be added to, applications, or tools to promote better security practices
6.	Easy Integration: The tool can be embedded in websites, applications, and security tools to promote better password practices.
Conclusion
This beginner-friendly cybersecurity project not only sharpens skills in Python and GUI development but also addresses a critical aspect of security—password strength. By ensuring users adopt stronger passwords, this tool helps in reducing vulnerabilities associated with weak credentials.
